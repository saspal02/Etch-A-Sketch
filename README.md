# Etch-A-Sketch

Welcome to the Etch A Sketch Project! This project is a digital rendition of the classic Etch A Sketch toy, where you can draw on a grid using your mouse. It's a fun way to practice and showcase your skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a particular focus on DOM manipulation and event listeners.
